# Excel Manipulation
This is a simple python file used to reformat an excel spreadsheet.

This may be useful if:
- You regularly download a report that needs reformatting before you use it.
- You need to concatenate cells, etc.
- You just like reading code.

I hope this code is in some way helpful.
